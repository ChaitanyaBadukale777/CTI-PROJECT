            <h2>[Description of Broken Access Control Vulnerability]</h2> <br>
            <p>
                <span style="font-size: larger;">To clearly understand this vulnerability, it is important to first
                    understand the following key terms:</span>
                <br><br>
                1. <span class="highlight">Authentication</span>: Verifies the identity of a user to ensure only
                legitimate users can access the system. Methods include passwords, biometrics, or tokens. For Example ->
                Providing username and password will verify the user's identity.<br><br>
                2. <span class="highlight">Session Management</span>: Handles user sessions securely after
                authentication. It ensures valid sessions, assigns unique session IDs, and prevents session
                hijacking. <b>Session Token</b> helps us to authenticate automatically each time we make a request to
                authenticated pages such change password, payment pages, etc.<br><br>
                3. <span class="highlight">Access Control</span>: Enforces rules to determine what authenticated users
                can do. It ensures users can only access data or perform actions they are authorized for. For Example ->
                A normal user will only be able view his account and make changes in it while keeping other users
                account secure.<br>
                <u>Types of Access Control:</u><br>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Vertical Access Control</u>: Controls access based on privilege levels (e.g., a regular user
                    cannot access admin-only pages).</li>
                <li><u>Horizontal Access Control</u>: Controls access to resources of other users with the same
                    privilege level (e.g., User A cannot view User B's private files).</li>
                <li><u>Context-Dependent Access Control</u>: Restricts access based on specific conditions (e.g., a user
                    can only edit their profile during working hours).</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <span class="highlight">Broken Access Control</span>: Broken Access Control vulnerability arises when users
            can act outside of their intended permissions. This typically leads to sensitive information disclosure,
            unauthorized access and modification or destruction of data.<br>
            <span>Types of Broken Access Control:</span><br>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Vertical Privilege Escalation</u>: Low-privilege user accessing high-privilege functions (e.g.,
                    regular user accessing admin dashboards).</li>
                <li><u>Horizontal Privilege Escalation</u>: User accessing another user's data (e.g., User A viewing
                    User B's private files).</li>
                <li><u>Access Control Vulnerability in Multi-Step Processes</u>: Exploiting access flaws across multiple
                    steps (e.g., skipping steps in a checkout process).</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <span class="highlight" ">Countermeasures:</span>
            <ol>
                <li>Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign least privilege access.</li>
                <li>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</li>
                <li>Log and audit access control failures.</li>
                <li>Enforce server-side access control rules.</li>
                <li>Except for public resources, deny access by default.</li>
                <li>Use security centric design where access is verified first and ensure all requests go through an
                    access control check.</li>
            </ol> <br><br>
            <span class=" highlight">To better understand, let's look at an example of both vulnerable and secure code
                :</span><br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b><u>Vulnerable code</u></b> -> While deleting user there are no checks for user role or login,
                    user role must be "Admin" or user whose account is set to delete must be logged in. In this code
                    while deleting user, function is just fetching database about existence of user and if user exists
                    then it is deleted directly and if user does not exist it returns "user not found". In short no
                    security checks are done. </li>
                <li><b><u>Secure code</u></b> -> While deleting user it first calls a function <b>is_admin()</b> which
                    checks if action is performed by Admin or not. If user is Admin, account is fetched from database
                    and that account is deleted and if user is not admin then access to delete account is restricted by
                    default and HTTP 403 access denied error is returned.
                </li>
            </ul>
